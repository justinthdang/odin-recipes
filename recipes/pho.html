            <p>
                Authentic, Vietnamese pho soup is all about the broth! Beef bones, fish sauce, star anise, and ginger simmer for at least 6 hours, creating a complex, aromatic broth that may not be quick, but it's certainly delicious. The flavorful broth is ladled over rice noodles and thinly sliced beef and topped with fresh garnishes.

            <ol>
                <li>Gather all ingredients.</li>
                <li>Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).</li>
                <li>Place beef bones on a baking sheet and roast in the preheated oven until browned, about 1 hour.</li>
                <li>Place onion halves on a second baking sheet and roast on another rack until blackened and soft, about 45 minutes.</li>
                <li>Transfer beef bones and onion halves to a large stockpot. Add ginger, salt, star anise, fish sauce, and 4 quarts water; bring to a boil. Reduce heat to low and simmer for 6 to 10 hours. Strain the broth into a saucepan and set aside.</li>
                <li>Place rice noodles in a large bowl filled with room temperature water. Let soak for 1 hour. Drain.</li>
                <li>When noodles have soaked for 1 hour, heat up the reserved broth by bringing it to a simmer.</li>
                <li>Bring a large pot of water to a boil. Cook the noodles in the boiling water for 1 minute. Drain.</li>
                <li>Divide noodles among 4 serving bowls; top with sirloin, cilantro, and green onion. Ladle hot broth over the top. Stir and let sit until beef is partially cooked and no longer pink, 1 to 2 minutes.</li>
